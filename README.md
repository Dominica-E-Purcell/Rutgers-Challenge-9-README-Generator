# Rutgers-Challenge-9-README-Generator
## Description


My motiviation for this project was simplify and streamline the process of generating a README.md for a github repository. I wanted to create a project that helped break down making a README into simple individual steps, to help with mental originizatio. I have found that being able to articulate each prompt individually has been an important step in distilling the essence of a project that I have worked on. I have learned about different sections of a project call on each other to create a simple but dynamic interative experience. 

## Installation
In the terminal
Make sure to npm install 
To start the Generator run: 'node index.js'
